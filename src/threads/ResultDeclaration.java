/*
The declareResult() method waits until another thread calls
notify(). During wait(), the thread releases the lock, allowing
other threads to enter the synchronized code.

ℹ Points to remember:
⭐ sleep() -> time based
⭐ wait() -> condition based
⭐ wait() -> releases lock -> by checking the notify() method
⭐ wait() is used in inter-threaded communication
☑ Order-Placed -> Preparing -> Prepared -> Delivering - Delivered ️
