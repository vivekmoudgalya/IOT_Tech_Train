/*
ℹ Code Explanation:
Initially the thread is in the NEW state. After calling start(),
it moves to RUNNABLE and executes the run() method.
The exact timing of the state changes depends on the
JVM Scheduler
ℹ Points to remember:
⭐ Thread is created once.
⭐ start() changes state
⭐ Thread cannot be restarted
⭐ Final state is TERMINATED or DEAD
