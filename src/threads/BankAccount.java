/*
Both the threads t1 & t2 access & modify the same balance variable
simultaneously. Due to lack of synchronisation, the final balance becomes
inconsistent.
ℹ Points to remember:
⭐ Shared data causes issues
⭐ Execution order is unpredictable
⭐ Leads to data inconsistency
⭐ Need synchronisation to solve the RACE CONDITION ️
