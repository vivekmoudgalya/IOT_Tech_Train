/*
Points to remember
⭐ Java program starts with one main thread.
⭐ Threads allow parallel execution -> concurrency
⭐ Output order is not guaranteed
⭐ Threads share the same memory
⭐ Improves the performance & responsiveness
⭐ When start() is called, the JVM creates a new Thread
⭐ When run() is called directly, there is no concurrency
ℹ Process Vs Thread
⭐ Process is a running program
⭐ Thread : A path of execution inside the program
⭐ A process has its own memory
⭐ Threads share the same memory
⭐ Creating a Thread is cheaper than creating a Process
⭐ Examples: Process -> Chrome Browser Thread -> New Tab Of Chrome
🟢 Closing a tab will not close Chrome or kill Chrome
