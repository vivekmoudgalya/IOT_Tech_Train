/*
Code Explanation:
The synchronized keyword ensures that only one thread can execute
withdraw() operation at a time, preventing RACE CONDITION and ensuring
correct balance deduction.

ℹ Points to remember:
⭐ Synchronisation avoids RACE CONDITION
⭐ Locks critical section in an application
⭐ Slower but safe
⭐ Essential for shared resources ️
